'Instructions: Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total
    'amount of volume each stock had over the year

'display ticker signal to coincide with the total volume
    
'make code able to be moved to stock excel as is

'expected references from past excercises:
    'credit card checkever activity inlcuded tallying total purchase for each card and including it
    'in a new column, had 1 sheet
    
    'Wells fargo part 1 unsolved included 1 sheet for each states deposits labeled in the sheet tab name
    'multi year data combined to 1 each states sheet; SOLVED shows adding net new column for state in each
    'sheet and extracted it from tab sheet name to display in new new column, example displays working
    'with multiple sheets within work sheet
    
    'Wells fargo part 2 solved displays activity where info from multiple sheets is grand
    'totalled on new sheet by year
    
    'in this excercise need column J to grand total stock volume of column G in 7 total tabs A B C D E F P
    
    'in this excercise need column I to show the appropriate ticker symbol for the total volume of that stock
    'displayed in column J
 
    ''****above notes types before getting started...after starting I'm here:

Sub test3()
'variable declarations with names of column headers
Dim ticker As String
Dim volume As Long


    'variable declaration of net new column header of totalstockvolume per ticker in column J with initial
    'value for place holding as 0
    Dim totalstockvolume As Long
    totalstockvolume = 0
    
    'variable declaration of net new column head of tickersymbol in column I with initial value for place holding
    'as 0
    Dim tickerletter As String
    tickerletter = 0
    
    'define worksheets
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    
    '''this is where I can't seem to figure out how to tell it
      '1.I need it to look at the data in column A starting on row 2 and continuing until the end of data
           'in that column
      '2. I need it to add column G starting on row 2 and continuing until the end of data in that column
      '3. I need it to do the same thing on all 7 worksheets
      '4. I need it to sum
    
    ''''' I pasted in and changed some code below from some of the past excercises thinking I would
        'follow the logic to understand the majority of the mapping on the new excercise, leaving it
        'below for now until we talk
    
'won't allow saving with 2 longs?

    
    
  
For i = 2 To rowcount
Dim rowcount As Long
rowcount = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row



  
            '''should this be (1,(i+1) instead? on the stock one?  (i+1, 1) is from original credit card example but it had values going down the column. (I still can't get these numbered columns straight!!!'
            ''does this part add up the ticker letter or the volume??? I think that is what screwed me up trying to interpret from the CC example excercise
    ' Check if we are still within the same ticker letter, if it is not...
    If Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> Cells(i, 1).Value Then


      ' Set the tickerletter
      tickerletter = Cells(i, 1).Value


      ' Add to the ticker
      Brand_Total = Brand_Total + Cells(i, 3).Value
      

      ' Print the ticker symbol in the Summary Table
      Range("G" & Summary_Table_Row).Value = Brand_Name

      ' Add one to the summary table row
      Summary_Table_Row = Summary_Table_Row + 1
      
      
      ' Reset the Brand Total
      Brand_Total = 0

    ' If the cell immediately following a row is the same brand...
    Else

      ' Add to the Brand Total
      totalstockvolume = totalstockvolume + Cells(10, 2).Value
